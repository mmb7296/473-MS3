## Exploring Rainfall Propagation Off Sumatran Coast
This project aims to analyze the propagation of rainfall off the coast of Sumatra by mapping relevant variables such as precipitation, winds, temperature, and cloud cover, with the goal of better understanding and perhaps better predicting precipitation and its movements in an area that faces particularly intense rainfall.  
This project makes use of a 10-year ERA5 Reanalysis dataset, spanning 2010-2019, which is accessible via the EMCWF, and a precipitation dataset derived from that dataset via code by Jingyi Hu with the Pennsylvania State University.
